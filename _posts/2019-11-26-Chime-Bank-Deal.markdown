Chime is a no fee online bank. 

They are running a promo where if you open an account and make a $200 direct deposit, you get $50 credited to your account almost instantly. There are no catches, and you can close the account at any time fee free as soon as you register their debit card (gotta wait a few days to get it in the mail). 

**How to trigger a Direct Deposit without Payroll:**

* A "direct deposit" technically means that they want you to deposit the money right from payroll, but you can actually meet this requirement simply by transferring in $200 from CASH APP!

* To do it with Cash App, deposit $200 to cash app, tap “cash card” at the top of the screen, tap “cash out” and then cash out to the chime bank account. If you don’t see chime as a cashout option, you have to connect it as a funding source/bank account for cashapp.

* If you don't have cash app, you can also transfer in $200 from the following banks to fulfill the same requirements- American Express, Ally, Chase, Charles Schwab, Circle Pay App, Discover, TD Bank, Hancock Whitney, Wells Fargo, Huntington, PNC, Serve, SoFi, TD Bank, USAA, and U.S. Bank.
